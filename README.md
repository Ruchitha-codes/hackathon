# AI-Powered Social Engineering Detection Platform

## The Problem  
Social engineering attacks—including phishing, pretexting, and business email compromise (BEC)—remain the top cause of data breaches. Traditional email filters often fail against sophisticated AI-generated or highly contextual attacks. This project addresses the need for an intelligent platform that recognizes subtle communication manipulations and warns users in real time.

## The Solution (Demo)  
We built an AI-driven web application that detects complex social engineering attempts by analyzing communication content, patterns, and metadata. Key features include:

- Secure user authentication with email duplication check and security-themed background  
- User dashboard displaying profile details and options to upload text, images, or files  
- Advanced NLP detecting manipulation tactics, urgency, suspicious links, and abnormal patterns  
- Image and metadata analysis to uncover hidden threats  
- Adaptive AI models that learn and update with new threat patterns  
- Clear threat level indicators with color codes:  
  - 🟢 Green: Safe  
  - 🟠 Orange: Medium threat  
  - 🔴 Red: High threat  
- Popup notifications with sound alerts and concise NLP-generated explanations  
- AI/NLP integration constituting around 25% of total functionality



## Tech Stack  

| Layer       | Technology                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Frontend    | React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios  |
| Backend     | Node.js, Express.js, Python (Flask), JWT  |
| Database    | MongoDB                        |

## Novelty / Innovation  
- Unique combination of real-time detection and educational feedback empowers users beyond mere alerts  
- Multi-format analysis (text, images, metadata) extends social engineering detection capability  
- Adaptive learning models keep pace with evolving attack strategies  
- User-focused threat indicators and popup alerts improve awareness and prompt action  

## Future Work  
- Develop browser/email plugins for seamless real-time protection  
- Expand language support with transformer-based NLP models  
- Add visual phishing detection for screenshots and PDFs  
- Create gamified security awareness training for users  
- Scale platform with cloud deployment for enterprise use
